# Zebrasim
Matlab MC code to predict the number of images needed for a rolling window DL model for zebrafish classification

This Monte Carlo simulation uses the average measured successful matching probability between two image data sets collected at different times where there is some feature changes in the classes but no change in the number of classes. The probabilty of successful cross-day matching of each class is treated as independent.
